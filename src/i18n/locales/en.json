  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Answers to common questions",
    "q1": "Do I need to know how to code?",
    "a1": "No! jeesi.ai is designed specifically for non-technical users. You simply chat with the assistant in natural language, and it builds the agent for you.",
    "q2": "How long does it take to create an agent?",
    "a2": "You can create a simple agent in just a few minutes. More complex agents may require 15-30 minutes. It all depends on your needs and desired functionality.",
    "q3": "What are credits and how are they used?",
    "a3": "Credits are jeesi.ai's usage units. Each agent creation, edit, or conversation with the assistant consumes credits. The free Basic tier gives you 5 daily credits (max 50/month). Pro tier gives 5 daily + 150 monthly credits, and Expert tier gives 250 credits per month.",
    "q4": "How does pricing work?",
    "a4": "We offer four tiers: Basic (free, 50 credits/month), Pro (€29.99/month, 155 credits/month), Expert (€49.99/month, 250 credits/month) and Custom (tailored pricing). Pro and Expert subscribers can purchase additional credits as needed: 50 credits €9.99, 100 credits €14.99, 200 credits with special pricing.",
    "q5": "Can I buy more credits?",
    "a5": "Yes! Pro and Expert tier users can purchase additional credits anytime: 50 credits €9.99, 100 credits €14.99, or 200 credits. Purchased credits are saved and roll over to the next month, so they don't expire.",
    "q6": "What happens to unused credits?",
    "a6": "Pro and Expert tier monthly credits roll over to the next month, so you don't lose them! Daily free credits (5 per day) don't accumulate though, they are available daily. Basic tier daily credits are capped at 50 credits per month.",
    "q7": "Can agents be integrated into existing systems?",
    "a7": "Yes! Agents can be embedded on websites, integrated via API, or connected to existing tools. We support the most common integrations out of the box. Note that agent publishing and integration require Pro tier or higher subscription.",
    "q8": "Can I change my subscription tier later?",
    "a8": "Yes you can! You can upgrade your subscription anytime to a higher tier, and the change takes effect immediately. Downgrading to a lower tier takes effect at the start of the next billing period. All purchased additional credits are preserved when changing subscription.",
    "q9": "Is my data secure?",
    "a9": "Absolutely. We are GDPR-compliant and all data is encrypted. Service with support, and you have full control over your data.",
    "q10": "What if I need help?",
    "a10": "We offer customer support directly in chat or via email. We also have comprehensive documentation and video guides to help you get started.",
