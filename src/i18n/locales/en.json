  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Answers to common questions",
    "q1": "Do I need to know how to code?",
    "a1": "No! jeesi.ai is designed specifically for non-technical users. You simply chat with the assistant in natural language, and it builds the agent for you.",
    "q2": "How long does it take to create an agent?",
    "a2": "You can create a simple agent in just a few minutes. More complex agents may require 15-30 minutes. It all depends on your needs and desired functionality.",
    "q3": "What are credits and how are they used?",
    "a3": "Credits are jeesi.ai's usage units. Each agent interaction consumes credits. All plans include 5 daily bonus credits that reset each day. Free tier gets 50 credits/month, Starter gets 100/month, Pro gets 500/month, and Business gets 1,000/month.",
    "q4": "How does pricing work?",
    "a4": "We offer five tiers: Free (€0, 2 agents, 50 credits/month), Starter (€19/month, 5 agents, 100 credits/month), Pro (€49/month, 10 agents, 500 credits/month), Business (€99/month, unlimited agents, 1,000 credits/month), and Enterprise (custom pricing). Annual billing saves 20%.",
    "q5": "Can I buy more credits?",
    "a5": "Yes! All paid tier users can purchase additional credits anytime: 100 credits for €19.90, 250 credits for €29.99, 500 credits for €49.90, or 1,000 credits for €84.90. Purchased credits roll over and don't expire.",
    "q6": "What happens to unused credits?",
    "a6": "Monthly credits roll over to the next month on paid plans, so you don't lose them! Daily bonus credits (5 per day) reset each day and don't accumulate. This ensures you always have fresh credits available daily.",
    "q7": "Can agents be integrated into existing systems?",
    "a7": "Yes! Agents can be embedded on websites, integrated via API, or connected to existing tools. We support common integrations out of the box. Free tier has limited integrations, while Starter and above get full integration access.",
    "q8": "Can I change my subscription tier later?",
    "a8": "Yes! You can upgrade your subscription anytime, and the change takes effect immediately. Downgrading takes effect at the start of the next billing period. All purchased additional credits are preserved when changing plans.",
    "q9": "Is my data secure?",
    "a9": "Absolutely. We are GDPR-compliant and all data is encrypted. Service with support, and you have full control over your data.",
    "q10": "What if I need help?",
    "a10": "We offer customer support directly in chat or via email. We also have comprehensive documentation and video guides to help you get started.",
